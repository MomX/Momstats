# Momstats

The goal of ‘Momstats’ is to provide statistical methods on top of
‘Momocs2’ tibbles, and chiefly multivariate methods on morphometric
data.

This includes mean shapes, principal component analyses along with
morphological space reconstruction, multivariate hypothesis testing,
linear discriminant analyses with permutations and balancing,
hierachical clustering methods, kmeans and kmedoids, etc.

Visualization is at heart with several extensions to ‘ggplot2’ graphics.

A light dispatching strategy makes it comfortable and consistent to use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Momstats from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak") # once on CRAN
pak::pak("MomX/Momstats") # from Github
```

# Package index

## Statistical analyses

Core functions

- [`stat_pca()`](https://momx.github.io/Momstats/reference/stat_pca.md)
  : Principal Component Analysis for morphometric data
- [`plot(`*`<stat_pca>`*`)`](https://momx.github.io/Momstats/reference/plot.stat_pca.md)
  : Plot PCA results
- [`collect(`*`<stat_pca>`*`)`](https://momx.github.io/Momstats/reference/collect.stat_pca.md)
  : Collect PC scores from PCA results

## Verbs

That applies to all stat\_\*

- [`collect()`](https://momx.github.io/Momstats/reference/collect.md) :
  Collect results from statistical analyses

## Data
