\title{Bottle outlines with elliptic Fourier transform coefficients}
\format{
A tibble with 40 rows and 5 variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{coo}: List-column of class \code{out} containing outline coordinates
(nx2 matrices). Outlines have been centered, scaled to unit centroid size,
aligned using PCA, and rotated so the rightmost point is at 0 radians.
\item \code{type}: Factor with 2 levels ("whisky", "beer") indicating bottle type.
\item \code{dummy}: Factor with 1 level ("a") - a dummy grouping variable for examples.
\item \code{length}: Numeric vector containing the length of each outline along the
major inertia axis (computed before standardization).
\item \code{coe}: List-column of class \code{c("eft", "coe", "list")} containing
elliptic Fourier transform coefficients. Each element is a named numeric
vector with 24 coefficients (6 harmonics × 4 coefficients: A, B, C, D)
representing the shape in Fourier space.

\description{
A dataset containing 40 bottle outlines that have been preprocessed and
transformed using elliptic Fourier analysis. This dataset is used for
demonstrating statistical methods in Momstats.
}
\details{
This dataset was created from the original \code{bot} dataset through the
following preprocessing pipeline:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Length measurement}: Original outline lengths were computed and stored
\item \strong{Centering}: Outlines translated to origin (centroid at 0,0)
\item \strong{Scaling}: Outlines scaled to unit centroid size
\item \strong{Alignment}: Outlines aligned along major inertia axis using PCA
\item \strong{Rotation}: Outlines rotated so rightmost point is at 0 radians
\item \strong{Fourier transform}: Elliptic Fourier analysis with 6 harmonics
}

The preprocessing standardizes size, position, and orientation, making the
outlines directly comparable for statistical analysis. The elliptic Fourier
coefficients provide a compact representation of shape that can be used with
multivariate statistical methods like PCA, LDA, and clustering.
\subsection{Fourier Coefficients}{

Each coefficient vector contains 24 values organized as:
\itemize{
\item A1-A6: First harmonic coefficients (x-axis cosine terms)
\item B1-B6: Second harmonic coefficients (x-axis sine terms)
\item C1-C6: Third harmonic coefficients (y-axis cosine terms)
\item D1-D6: Fourth harmonic coefficients (y-axis sine terms)
}

Higher harmonics capture finer shape details, while lower harmonics represent
the overall shape structure.
