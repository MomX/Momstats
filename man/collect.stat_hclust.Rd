\title{Collect cluster assignments from hierarchical clustering}
\usage{
\method{collect}{stat_hclust}(x, data = NULL, k = NULL, h = NULL, name = "cluster", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{stat_hclust} object}

\item{data}{A tibble. If NULL, uses the original data.}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of clusters to cut tree into.}

\item{h}{Numeric. Height at which to cut tree.}

\item{name}{Character. Name for cluster assignment column. Default is "cluster".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (reserved)}
}
\value{
A tibble with cluster assignments added
}
\description{
Extract cluster assignments from hierarchical clustering and add them to a tibble.
}
\details{
If the tree was already cut during \code{stat_hclust()}, those clusters are used
unless \code{k} or \code{h} is specified here.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
hc <- boteft \%>\% stat_hclust()

# Cut and collect
collect(hc, k = 4)

# Different k
collect(hc, k = 5)

# Cut by height
collect(hc, h = 10)

# Custom column name
collect(hc, k = 3, name = "hc_cluster")
}
