\title{Transduce k-means cluster centers to shapes}
\usage{
\method{transduce}{stat_kmeans}(object, positions)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{stat_kmeans} object}

\item{positions}{A tibble with cluster specifications. Must contain a \code{cluster}
column with cluster numbers (1 to k).}
}
\value{
A tibble with reconstructed coefficients and shapes
}
\description{
Reconstruct shapes at cluster centers or at positions relative to centers.
}
\details{
For k-means, transduce simply retrieves the cluster centers from the model
and reconstructs the corresponding shapes. Since cluster centers are already
in the original predictor space, no inverse transformation is needed.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
km <- boteft \%>\% stat_kmeans(k = 3)

# Get shapes at all cluster centers
centers <- transduce(km, tibble(cluster = 1:3))

# Get shape at specific cluster
center1 <- transduce(km, tibble(cluster = 1))
}

}
